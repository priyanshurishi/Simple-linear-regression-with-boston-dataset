# Simple-linear-regression-with-boston-dataset
Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x). 
Here, we will take the loaded dataset from the sklearn library.
The name of the dataset will be the boston dataset.
The result of the model will show the graph which contains the residual errors in that datset.
